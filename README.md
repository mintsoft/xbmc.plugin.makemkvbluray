xbmc.plugin.makemkvbluray
=========================

Fork of MakeMKV support for XBMC that maintains remote support

Based on the original version from here: http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=67420

All subsequent versions provided by others have removed the remote functionality as presumably they don't use it. 

I have a somewhat esoteric setup inwhich the blu-ray is installed in my home server and no optical media exists in
my HTPC itself; therefore the remote functionality is the *only* functionality that matters to me.

Tested with Kodi 14.0 (Helix)
